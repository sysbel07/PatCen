# PatCen
A blockchain-based Patient-Centric mechanism for the granular access control of infectious disease-related tests records

Project Description:
This GitHub repository contains an implimentation code for an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) access control mechanism using blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and privacy of patient data. This system addresses the urgent need for secure health data management highlighted by the global spread of diseases like COVID-19. It features a blockchain-integrated role-based access control (RBAC) that strictly regulates data access to authorized personnel only, maintaining patient privacy and consent.

Key Features
Blockchain Integration: Utilizes blockchain's immutable and decentralized nature to safeguard data integrity and restrict unauthorized access.
Role-Based Access Control: Implements precise control mechanisms within the blockchain to manage data access based on user roles.
Enhanced Security and Efficiency: Offers significant improvements in security measures, reducing computing overhead, and increasing throughput and latency compared to traditional systems.
Contributions
This project significantly advances healthcare data management by providing a secure, efficient, and patient-centered approach. It is designed to be scalable, making it suitable for broad adoption in diverse healthcare settings.

Usage and Implementation
The code is structured for easy implementation and is adaptable to various healthcare environments. Users are encouraged to explore and modify the system as needed to suit specific requirements.

This repository is intended for healthcare providers, IT professionals in healthcare, and researchers focused on medical data security. By sharing this code, we aim to promote collaboration and further innovation in healthcare technology security.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and initiate discussions in the repository. Your feedback is crucial as we strive to improve healthcare data management in the digital age.
